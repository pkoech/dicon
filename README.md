# dicon
You will find my project reports under the ``Reports`` folder, project designs documents under ``Designs``, #sample python code under ``sample_python`` and sample c code under ``sample_c folder``.

Under reports and designs folders you will find sample reports and designs for operating system class that I took at UC Berkeley. The c code that I included is from the operating systems project. 

For the python code I provided, they are from my networking class.
