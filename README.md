# dicon
You will find my project reports under the ``Reports`` folder, project designs documents under ``Designs``, #sample python code under ``sample_python`` and sample c code under ``sample_c folder``.

Under reports and designs folders you will find sample reports and designs for operating system class that I took at UC Berkeley. The c code that I included is from the operating systems project. Code in thread.c contains some snippets of thread implementation for the operating system(pintos) and cache.c contains code for implementing caching.

For the python code I provided, they are from my networking class. ``router.py`` contains code for packet routing algorithm and the code in transport_layer.py is an implementation of simple Transport Layer Protocol (TCP).
